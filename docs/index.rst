dj-geocoding: quick and easy geocoding
======================================

dj-geocoding is a Django app that has two goals:

1. Provide basic geodata functionality without requiring PostGIS
2. Make geocoding accessible and easy to integrate in the Django admin

PostGIS is fantastic but isn't always available.
